## Data Source : MIMIC-III

The MIMIC-III database (version 1.4, 2016) is a publicly available critical care database containing de-identified data on 46,520 patients and 58,976 admissions to the ICU of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, USA, between 1 June, 2001 and 31 October, 2012. These data include comprehensive information, such as demographics, admitting notes, International Classification of Diseases-9th revision (ICD-9) diagnoses, laboratory tests, medications, procedures, fluid balance, discharge summaries, vital sign measurements undertaken at the bedside, caregivers notes, radiology reports, and survival data12. After successful completion of the National Institutes of Health Protecting Human Research Participants web-based training course, we obtained approval to extract data from MIMIC-III for research purposes (Certification Number: 28860101).
